f | line-radial-test.js | s | 5.3K | 105 | Mike Bostock | mbostock@gmail.com | 1329602641 |  | Consolidate everything into d3.v2.js.  Rather than producing separate files for each module, the default build now produces a single file. This should encourage better page-load performance as the files were relatively small. Also, it's easier to deal with only one file rather than many, especially if you're not quite sure what the dependencies are. You may still create minimized builds, if you don't want every feature.  This commit also demotes the chart components to the examples directory, rather than keeping them as part of the core library. As always, D3 is not a charting library, and these were ever only intended to serve as examples.

This fixes a crash with the symbol type "hasOwnProperty", rather than defaulting to "circle". This commit also adds new map methods to retrieve the keys, values and entries. The map class now uses non-enumerable properties (if supported).

f | brush-test.js | s | 2.1K | 59 | Mike Bostock | mbostock@gmail.com | 1330482460 |  | Fix drift in brush extent.  Previously, if you set the brush extent externally, the extent could drift slightly because it was internally stored in pixel space rather than in data space. To avoid drift, the brush now preserves the extent exactly as-set, only nullifying the externally-set extent when the brush is moved.
