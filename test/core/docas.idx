f | selection-style-test.js | s | 4.0K | 94 | Mike Bostock | mbostock@gmail.com | 1329602641 |  | Consolidate everything into d3.v2.js.  Rather than producing separate files for each module, the default build now produces a single file. This should encourage better page-load performance as the files were relatively small. Also, it's easier to deal with only one file rather than many, especially if you're not quite sure what the dependencies are. You may still create minimized builds, if you don't want every feature.  This commit also demotes the chart components to the examples directory, rather than keeping them as part of the core library.
