d | sizzle |  | 3 items |  | Michael Bostock | mbostock@gmail.com | 1297972573 |  | Support for Sizzle.  D3 now supports Sizzle, preferring Sizzle to the native Selectors API if Sizzle is available. Sizzle internally uses the native Selectors API and thus this should have minimal performance implications; also, it allows you to use Sizzle proprietary extensions such as ":first".  This commit also restricts the definition of the enter selection so that only append and insert operations are defined. The other operations were generally unsupported anyway, and it cleans up the code to have separate implementations for insert and append. (I might enable additional operations in the future, such as `filter`, `sort` and `each`, but this seems like a reasonable first pass.)
