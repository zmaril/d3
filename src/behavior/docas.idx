f | behavior.js | s | 18B | 1 | Michael Bostock | mbostock@gmail.com | 1297458041 |  | Add d3.behavior module.  Includes, as the first behavior, a pan & zoom behavior. The canvas can be panned by dragging the mouse, and zoomed using the mousewheel (or by double-click). By listening to redraw events, users can decide whether to implement geometric zooming (such as by setting the "transform" attribute on an `svg:g` element) or semantic zooming (by changing the domain of a scale object and repositioning elements).  This commit also includes two bug fixes. The `d3.format` class now properly groups thousands of negative numbers, and supports the sign specifier. The unicode minus symbol \u2212 is used for negative values. The `d3.scale.pow` class now properly handles negative numbers, as well.
