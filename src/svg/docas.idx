f | symbol.js | s | 2.3K | 90 | Mike Bostock | mbostock@gmail.com | 1332196995 |  | Better implementation of defined.  The previous implementation had a bug where the original index (i) was not preserved if the input data array were split. The new implementation eschews the previous approach of branching based on whether the x- and y-properties are defined as functions or constants, opting for the simpler functor approach. The x- and y-values are also coerced to numbers, as appropriate.
f | axis.js | s | 7.4K | 183 | Mike Bostock | mbostock@gmail.com | 1330299986 |  | Inheritance for transition.each.  If you use d3.transition(selection) within the context of a transition.each, the created transition will automatically inherit the delay, duration and easing of the parent transition. Likewise, if you use d3.transition(selection) within the context of a selection.each, it simply returns the passed-in selection with no transition at all. This makes it easier to create components, such as the axis, that support automatic transitions.
