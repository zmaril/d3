f | bounds.js | s | 2.3K | 73 | Jason Davies | jason@jasondavies.com | 1329711108 |  | Use hasOwnProperty in d3.geo.bounds.  This one's difficult to test for, and unlikely to occur in practice, but probably best to amend for consistency.
f | type.js | s | 179B | 5 | Mike Bostock | mbostock@gmail.com | 1329842557 |  | Harden d3_geo_type against object built-ins.
f | geo.js | s | 50B | 2 | Mike Bostock | mbostock@gmail.com | 1317108862 |  | Add d3.geo.greatArc.  The greatArc class is the new name for greatCircle, which actually represents great arcs. Meanwhile, a new greatCircle class is for great circles. The new greatCircle class replaces the old clip class, providing clipping and resampling functionality (using greatArc internally). This isn't backwards-compatible, but I may forgo the major version number bump in light of the fact that greatCircle was just added, and not used in any (official) examples or documented.

f | greatCircle.js | s | 36B | 1 | Mike Bostock | mbostock@gmail.com | 1317139223 |  | Add d3.geo.circle.  There is also a greatCircle as an alias, whose angle defaults to 90 degrees. (Or should, but some projections cannot handle 90 degrees so we use 89 instead.)
f | mercator.js | s | 926B | 31 | Mike Bostock | mbostock@gmail.com | 1317108862 |  | Add d3.geo.greatArc.  The greatArc class is the new name for greatCircle, which actually represents great arcs.
