f | splom.html | s | 393B | 13 | Mike Bostock | mbostock@gmail.com | 1329602641 |  | Consolidate everything into d3.v2.js.  Rather than producing separate files for each module, the default build now produces a single file. This should encourage better page-load performance as the files were relatively small. Also, it's easier to deal with only one file rather than many, especially if you're not quite sure what the dependencies are. You may still create minimized builds, if you don't want every feature.  This commit also demotes the chart components to the examples directory, rather than keeping them as part of the core library. As always, D3 is not a charting library, and these were ever only intended to serve as examples.
f | splom.css | s | 471B | 39 | Mike Bostock | mbostock@gmail.com | 1320259469 |  | Update SPLOM example to use d3.svg.brush.  This required a couple core changes. First, the brush shouldn't notify listeners when redrawing, because this commonly causes an infinite loop if one brush triggers a change in another brush (as in a scatterplot matrix, where only one brush is active at a given time). I suppose an alternative implementation might use just a single brush, and assign the axes dynmically; I might try that in a future commit. Second, I added a clear convenience method to reset a brush.
