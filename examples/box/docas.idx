Rather than producing separate files for each module, the default build now produces a single file. This should encourage better page-load performance as the files were relatively small. Also, it's easier to deal with only one file rather than many, especially if you're not quite sure what the dependencies are. You may still create minimized builds, if you don't want every feature.  This commit also demotes the chart components to the examples directory, rather than keeping them as part of the core library. As always, D3 is not a charting library, and these were ever only intended to serve as examples.

For example, what happens if we remove the whiskers in a transition? How do we join outliers? This commit makes a few assumptions explicit:  1. The `quartiles` function must return exactly three elements. This property must be specified as a function.  2. The `whiskers` function must return exactly 2 elements, or null if no whiskers are to be displayed. This property must be specified as a function.  3. The `domain` function must return exactly 2 elements, or null if the default domain should be used. This property can be specified either as a constant or as a function.  We could generalize this chart to support more than two whiskers, but it doesn't seem urgent, and it would complicate the transition if the number of whiskers changes. In a related change, the `whiskers` function does not receive a third argument containing the quartiles; instead, this is made available by the `quartiles` property on the values array (the first argument).  The outliers are joined using the `Number` key function. The outlier data is now stored as indices; this allows reasonable object constancy across transitions with outliers. Similarly, the tick labels for the quartiles are whiskers are now separated, such that the whisker labels can be added or removed without spurious transition.
