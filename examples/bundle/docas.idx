Rather than producing separate files for each module, the default build now produces a single file. This should encourage better page-load performance as the files were relatively small. Also, it's easier to deal with only one file rather than many, especially if you're not quite sure what the dependencies are. You may still create minimized builds, if you don't want every feature.  This commit also demotes the chart components to the examples directory, rather than keeping them as part of the core library. As always, D3 is not a charting library, and these were ever only intended to serve as examples.

The input to the layout is now an array of edges to bundle, rather than nodes. This eliminates the need for an `outgoing` accessor, since the links are passed to the bundle layout directly.  The svg line generator now supports a beta (straightening; bundle strength) parameter. I haven't decided if this is the right place or the right name for it, but it seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm not happy with the cos & sin needed to produce radial lines (both here and for the diagonal projection in other examples), but I don't have a good alternative yet.  This commit also tries to make the construction of the links from the layout nodes a bit easier to follow. The previous code was used another intermediate representation, and I think it's cleaner to construct the default format expected by the layouts. However, there's still a good chunk of code required to massage the JSON format into a node hierarchy and array of dependencies, so I'd like to find a way to simplify that, too.
